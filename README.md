# What it does
My initial goal for this project is to show knock-knock jokes in the most creative way given the skills I have in web dev.

Basics features of the project currently:
- Show the knock knock joke in sync with a [funny audio](https://youtu.be/bgr8z8Zm9WE?t=10) with cool animations.
- being able to add in your knock knock jokes or/and riddle through it

After 2 months of working on it(APR/22-JUN/22), I made a lot of additions, subtractions, and changes of plans. My learning aim for this project was to be familiar and comfortable with NextJs/ReactJs since this is my first time I use them. In addition to that, I wanted to get used to TypeScript.

Please [connect with me](#connect-with-me) if you have any good ideas to improve this project in any way.

# Technologies used

- **[NextJs](https://nextjs.org/)** to create a full-stack ReactJs Application.
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** to store the knock-knock jokes in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. (Thought that a [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) DB would suit this project's DB needs best).
- **[NotionAPI](https://developers.notion.com/)** to store the data the user sent from the [add-joke](https://knock-knock.vercel.app/add-joke) page in a [Notion database](https://www.notion.so/help/what-is-a-database) which I can turn into a [csv file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).
- **[SCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language))** to write CSS much quicker
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)** to make cool animations in ReactJs

# Future plans
For now I'm satisfied with what I created but I'm aware of the several possible improvements I can do on this project. But in terms of the big plans I would like to implement on this project:
- Faster render time
- Make the project more collaboration friendly using MongoDB
- Gamify the experience by giving points for every guessed riddle or knock-knock completion
